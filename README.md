# **Large Language Models Assignments and Coursework**

## **Overview**
This repository contains my current and future assignments' solutions in Intro to LLM during my master studies at TU Darmstadt. 

## **Concepts implemented**
### *HW 1:*
- Tweet sentiment classification (positive/negative)
- PyTorch MLP
- Transition-based Dependency Parsing
- Lesk NLP algorithm
- Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) using Lesk -> Basic and Extended (lemmatization)
### *HW 2:*
- Ranked retrieval using: TF-IDF, BM25 and LSA
- Trained Word2Vec(CBOW) with PyTorch
- LSA vs CBOW evaluation testing by Mean Average Precision
### *HW 3:*
- T5 encoder-decoder architecture
- Multiheader and Cross Multiheader Attention
- Machine translation

## **Usage Guideline**
These materials are only intended to serve as guides for learning and understanding LLM concepts. Please use them responsibly.
